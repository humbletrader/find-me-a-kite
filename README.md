# find-me-a-kite
* rest api to search kitesurfing products
* web UI for searching kitesurfing products

# todo
* pagination ( just provide a link to prev / next page - no need for extra count)
* bug : the twintip values from kitemana are wrong ( probably they don't have TVA)
* bug when searching for criteria 1 & criteria 2 & come back to criteria 1
* bug : don't allow the same criteria twice
